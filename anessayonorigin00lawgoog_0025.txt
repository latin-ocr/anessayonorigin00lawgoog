therefore of Non-einstence supplies the place of an ill Prin-

ciple in the Origin of Evil, as was said before. · ·
· 7. The Happiness and Perfefiion of every thing or A·
g ' gent arises from the due Exercise of those F aculties which
God has given it, and the more Faculties and Perfeciions
apyy thinegss has, ’tis capable of the greater and more perfect

a m .

· 8nghe less dependent on external things, the more sels-
sufficient any Agentis, and the more it has the principle
of its Adlions in itself, ’tis so much the more persedi3 Since
therefore we may conceive two Sorts of Agents, one which
do not aet, unless im lled and determined by external
force, the other which ave the Principle of their Adions .
within themselves, and can determine themselves to aftion
by their own natural Power: 'tis plain that the latter are
much much more perfeci than the former. Nor can it be
denied but that God may create an Agent with such a
power as this, which can exert itself into aenon, without
either the concourfe of God, or the determination of exter·
nal causes, so long as God by a general Concourse preserves
the Existence, Powers and F aculties of that Agent.

9. Such an Agent may prescribe to itself an End, and
prosecute it by proper Means, and take delight in the pro-
secution of it, though that· end‘might be persedly indiffe-
rent to it before it was proposed, and be no ¹more agree⁴
able than‘any other os the same or a different kind would
be, if the Agent had once resolved‘ to prosecute it. For
since all the pleafure or happiness which we receive, arises
from the due erlercise of our F aeulties, every thing which is
equally commodious for the exercise of our faculties, will ’

give us the same delight. The reason therefore why one
thing pleases above another is* founded in the Ast of the .

Agent himself, viz. his Eledtion. This is largely explained
in the Book itself, together with the limits within which it
is confined, and shall be illustrated more fully ‚hereasten
ro. It is impossible that all things should agree to all,
that is, be good, for since the things are limited, distinet
and different one from another, and are endowed with finite,
distin& and different appetitos, it necessarily follows that

the relations ot' convertent 3ηέ inconvenient must arise freyn
