Sethg'. Concerning' the‘Origin essenii. 61

REMARKS.

relcue this Divine Attribute from such an absurd interpre-
tation. ’

Now, if we attentively examine our Idea of Eternity‚ l be-
lieve wesstall find that it amounts to thus much: viz. unisonae, ,
invariablt er'stencer or finple Existente join'd with Neceffity:

. hy which‘lall Word we only understand an Inpofflbility of hav-
hrt„ hhhh‘ltffihltn llthllltltllhlitl
respefi, and perhaps we may more eafily and safely determine
what the manner of it is not, than what it isa o. g. that it con·
tinner not by tiene, ur in place. Indead local Extenſsoa and
sarreffive Duration are moder of the Existence of most Beings‚
and therefore we lind it ver difficule to consider any Exillence
without them: But as we have endeavoured ,τοι lhew the polli-
bilny of· removing the former from the Dtvtne Elsenoe, in
Notes 3, 6, andn7. so here, Ithiuk‚ it may he lhewn also that
the latter hat no necellary connection with it, hut rather the ·
co‘ihmorryder to do this, it will be necessary to explain what we <
mean by line, thch (according to Mt. Lacte) is of the very
same kind with Darationt and may properly be term'd a part
of it. This ir very well defin'd hy leibnitz, to be the Order
ef Succeffian of created Brings. We manilestly get the Notion
nsit by relletling on the Succeffion ol ldeas rn our Minds‚
which we areapt to conceive as a Chain drawn out in length,
of which all the particular ldeas are consider’d as the Linls.
Whereas, had we hutone invariare perception, without any such
Succetion of ldeas in our Minds, we could have no such No·
tion aa thiros Duration, but that of ureExistence only. Now
Exhlenre being evidently a hmple kdea, (tho' perhaps Dara·
tien be not) ir consequently incapable of a Definition‚ and wo
need, 1 think, only observe of it here, that if we join out ldea
of Duratirn to it, we still add nothing to the ldea of it asir ie

cessiry Inqgrrdienkdlkhe ἔτηξεν Idea, which is coritplete with-
out it. inre then, or Duration, is an ldea entirely resulting
from ourConfideration of the Exillence of Brings with reference
to a real or imaginary Sntceffion. Whence it will follow in the
first place, that we cannot poffibly stante any idea of this kind
of Duration without taking in Succession; and secondly, that we· ’
monor eafily separate the Exislrnte of any linire, changeahle
Beingt from thir kind of Duration.

Our next Enquity must be whether this Idea ol Duration be
wnnetled with the Exillence of those Beings entirely aa they
exist, or only at they exist in such a particular manner: Whe-
