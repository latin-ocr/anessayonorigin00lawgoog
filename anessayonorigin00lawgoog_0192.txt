out aoy Commerce with or dependente upon other Creatorem
especially suchat would incommode them. Why therefore
did God choose such aSystem ae made, room sor other imper·
sect, miserable Bcings.

We answer, that granting such Creatores as those above-
mention'd tobe possible, God hae actually created as many os
that Kind as the Syllem wou'd admit, insomuch that is there
had been more it wou’d have been more inconvenient. Nor
is it os any consequence whether we suppose this system to
be Finito or lnfinite. If F inite, 'tis plain thata certain Num÷
ber may sill it sothat there will be no room for more. Is -
lnhnite‚ inhnite Creatures os the same Kind will equally
srll an infinite system, as a finite Number will sill a sinite One; ’
sor there’s the same Propertion. ln this then ns well as the
sormer Syllem there will beno Place 'sor more. But yet
when this system or'Order of Creatutes is filled up, there
wou'd be roonr lest sor the other less perse& Orders, whose Na-
tures and Faculties might have a mutual Relation to each other
and whose Happiness might require their mutual Help and
Assrllance, 'Tis certain that many and various Ordere and
Degrces os this Kind were possible ; neither would they, is
created, be any impediment to the more perse& Order, which
is already compleated‚ and the Number os which could not
be increased without Damageto the Systemr neither would
the Addition os these inserior Orders and Degrecs, lessen the
Number os the prior and more perfectores. .

What therefore wasto hedone? Let us now suppose God
deliberating with himself (as aMan wou'd do) whether he
should create any os the inferior Order. Is he does, ’tio ma-
nifest that hc will introduce unneceslary Imperseslions into
his Works. Noy, srnce some os these may have Natures and
l'owerr contrary to euch other, it will be possible sor Clash-

. ing and Opposrtion to arise among his Creatores. lf hedoeu
not create thern, he will appear unkind in grudging an'd re·
fusrng them a Benefit‚ which he was able to communicate
without Detriment to the System. For l suppose these inse·
rior Ones not tq bc so very imperfect, but that their Existcnce

you’d he decrn'd a'g'rcnt and valuablc Blelling.
