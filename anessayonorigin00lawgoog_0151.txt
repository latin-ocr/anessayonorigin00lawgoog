&nothing stom which it is at thelame time totally and entire-

the Nature of the thing in general, and the particular Modus

stom the former foundation, and fix it upon tlte latter. - Far·

lunge of your Face supposed to be seen in the Glass, is no·
thing real, solid, and substantial contain'd in the Glass itself,
hut barely an ap earanee exhibited in the Brain; so all the
conceptione which we pretend to have os the Divine Na-
ture and Attributes, are nothing at all in God himself, but
nnete Pnannsms and delusrve iunges, exihing only in our own ’
Minci. This, will these Men say, rnust appear absurd at first
Sight. and -yet rnay be drawn from the Similitude with as much
