Ptel'r‘minary Differtation.' antiit
ite apprehend the concurrence of their Wills necelllrry, we
cannot but approve of whatever is apt to procure this cona
currente. And that can be only the Pleasure or Pain ex-
pected from it by them. And therefore as 1 perceive that
t my Happiness is dependent on others, I cannot but judge
whatever 1 apprehend to be proper to excite them to end
deavour to promote my Happinesa, to be a means of Hap-
piness, i. e. 1 cannot but approve it. And. since the annex-
ing Pleasure to their Endeavours to promote my Happi- ’,
ness ris the only' thing in my Power to this end, I cannot
but approve of the annexing Pleasure to such Aetiona of
theirs as are undertaken upon my account. Hence to ap-
prove of aRational Agent aa a means of Happiness‚ is dif-
ferent from the Approbation os any other means 3 because it
implies an A robationalso of an Endeavour to promote the
Happiness ofkhat Agmt, in order to excite him and others ’
to the same concern for my Happiness for the future.

And because what we approve of we also desire (as has
been lhewn above) hence also we desere the Happiness of any
Agent that has done us good And therefore Leve or Ha-
trad, when placed on a rational object, has this differente
from the love or Hatred of other things,· that it implies a·
defire of, and consequently a pleasure in the Happiness of
the Object beloved·, or if hated, the contrary. ’ ’

, The F oundation of this Approbarion and love (which,
aa we have seen, confists inhia voluntary contributing to
our Happiness) is called the Merit of the Agent so contri-·
buting‚ i. e. that whereby he is entitled (upon supposrtion
that we an like rational, sociable Creatures; like Creatures,
whose Happiness is dependent on each other’s Behaviour)
to our Approbation and love: Demerit the contrary.

And this Affection or Qualityof any Aetion which we ’

call Merit, is very consistent witha Man's abling ultimately
for his own private Happiness. For any particular Action
that is undertaken for the salu os another, is meritoriam, i. e.
deserves Esteem, F avaut, and Approbation from him for
whose sake it was undertaken‚ towards the Doer of it. For
the Presmnption of such Esteem, &a was the only Motive
to that notem and is such Esteem, &a does not follow,
or ia presumod aot to follow it, such a Person is reckoned1
