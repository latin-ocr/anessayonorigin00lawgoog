Hence allo it appears, why all things do not auswer every oue’a
Appetite. Why we are not euriched with aa many Benefica aa
the Capacity‘of our Nature seems to require. For tho’ the in«
finite Goodness of God encourages us ¹to promise ourselrea thus
much, yet Wisdom and Jullico set boanda as it were to hir
Goodness, aud ssiew that thie cannot'be done without Detri-‘
ment to the whole e that eilher thie Inconveuieuce muli be tole-¹
ra'ted, or uo such Creaturea medea and that it was better not
³ ' to give some lo great a Degree of Happiuesa ar their Naturae
might receive, than thata whole Species of Bein'g'asuould he

lf it be ah’d why God did not make thie Species in another
and more perfect Manner, so aa to be free from this Inconve·
κ nience. lanswer, that theu it· would have belonged to another
Species, and been of a different Orderof creatores: And Ι sup«¹
pose aa many of the Species to be made already ee the System
would adurit, but that there was still rooru for these Tioferior
ones, which rnuss necessarily have had the Nature they now are
olor noue at all, as hae been osten ¹said, and l'ut unwilliagly
