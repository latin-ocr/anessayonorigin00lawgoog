THE very Notion of a reasonable Creature implieS, that
¹ he propose to himself some End, and acl in pursuit os ⁴
it. The only Enquiry then can be, What End does Reason ,
direct him to pursue, and by what Mem shall he attain it?
Now a senstble Being, or one that is made capable of Hap-. < .
piness or Misery, can reasonably propose to himself no o-
ther End than the· Perfeenon of thinBeing, i. e. The At,
tainment of the one, and Avoidance of the other. He can
have no Reason or Motive to pursue that which does not Ι
at all relate to him ;- and it is evident that nothing does re-
late to him, but that which has relation to his Happiness. Π
hehe alsoendowed with Liberty ¹of Will, it is impossible that ·
any thing else should move or affert him; nor can any o-
ther Influence or Obligationbe laid upon him without an
express contradiction. If therefore right Reason can only
ssrew him to be what heis, and direct him to acl according-
ly, itis plain> it can propose to him no other End buthir Ι
own Happiness, beyond or befide which he can have no rer<
, alConcern to know, to acl, or to be. ’
Having seen the true End ofMan confider’d as a fenstble, .
rational, and free Being; we will in the next Place enquire'
after the Means of attaining this End. Now as Manis also
dependent on other Being's for that Happiness of which he is
made capable, the only Meam· of attaining it must beto
recommend himself to the Favour os those several Beings
on whom he does deperio, and in Degrees proportioned
to that Dependence. But as himself and all other Beings .
depend absolutely upon the Dei'ty, who alone has their .
Happiness or Misery always in his Power‚ it is plain the
Favour of God will be the only adequate and effestual'
Means to attain his End, i. e. Happiness upon the Whole:
And therefore, whatever tends to procure the Divine Fa-
your, will be os perpetual Obligation, and ought to be the
4 Pffll? ·
