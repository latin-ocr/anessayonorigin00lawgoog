Nor, Secondly, if there did, would this Neceffity of Nature
usually affigned ae such, ferne for that Purpofe. For first it is not
the Substance itfelf‚ that would be to make the same thing the
Ground of itfclf t which is nonsenfe· 'Tis therefore a Perfetiion,
Properat or Attribute of that Substance (we know no other Di·
, xtiinetion) and ae such mun, in the Order of our ideas, he Con·
foquent upon the existence of that Suhhance ln which it is sup·
posed to inhere. Whaterer it iu, it hae in fonte respeft or other
a relation to the sabjeet to which it helon s. Let ut then be an
Attribute sai generis, cryrtsnonque generis (iiwe mean any thing
at all by this Word) it must be predicaret of, and presoppese io
Subjnfh and consequentl cannot, accordin to the Order of
nur ldeas, be the antecedent ground orfoun tion of it. And to
endeavour to clear it (as some do) by making it not an Attri-
hnte of the Substance‚ hut of the attribute of the substancet or
'rue they phrase it, a Proper of a Property3 is only thrusting
it hill farther back, and rna ⁶ it posterior in conception to
both the §ubstance and ita Attriiute or Property.
