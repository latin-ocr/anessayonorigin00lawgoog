l “ On Morality and Religion.

Motive, Ground, or Principle on which Virtue ought to bo
pursued, und pointed out the proper Method of ap lying
it. To compleat our Desrgn upon this Subjeet, we hall now·
examine the material Part of Virtue, and obviate sorno
Mistakes that have arisen, and may still arise on that Head.
' The most common one is to put the Matter of any, .
Duty for the whole Duty. Thus some have defined moral
Goodness to be nothing more than chulrng, willing, or pro·

of Pleasure, i. e. in the Agenlhimlelfg3 or ihrhaursuing cpri-
vatr 'Happiness: But except these Writers intend to treat ,
only ol the material Part ofVirtue, whenever they describe
itin such Ternas, their Descriptions are evidently partia!
and defeffive. Moral Goodness, or Moral Virtue in Man is
not merely chuling or producing Pleasure or Natural Good‚
but chusrny it without View to present Rewards, and in

Prospedt o afuture Recornpenee only. For, observe how
the Cale stands. The greatest Natural Good of all is supro-
vided for by God, himself, by the strong Appetites he ·
has implanted in Men, or the Neoeffities he has laid them
under, that there is no Moral Goodness, no Virtue at all in
chusrng it. The greatest Natural GoodI call what concerno
the Being of the Moral World, and the second greatest,
what concerns their Well-being.. Now God has takeneare
to preserve the World in Being, to continue both the Sper
cies and Individual. 1. By implanting avery strong [iove
of Life in every Man. e. By the Appetites of Hunger and

Thirst. 3. By warrn Defires for propagatio the Species.
4. By the napi of Parents towards their Oflgsprin . 5. By
neceffitating Men to unite in Society, and nru Offices
of Trade, &o Upon these five Articles depends the very
Being of Maukind : And God would not trust such welph·

ty Things as those to the wealr Realon of Man, but as ἱ
provided for them by never-failing Appetites and Neceffi-
ties, insomuch that there is no Virtue in chusrng those .
Allions, but in regulatin or moderating them.
