linive been tlte lonffr on this Subjett of Abstra& Meas, srnce
notwithstanding what ΜΓ. Lockr has hinted, the nature of 'ern
ferme to be but little understood, otherwise we lhould never
hear os our Idea of Irpinity, of Spore, Duratium, Number, dcc.
requiring an external Ileanmr or objeetivr reality; - of their
being real Attributes and neceifarily inferring the Existence of
forne immense and eternal Beingr -whereas all universale,
or abstrait loeas, such aa these evidently are, (See Dr. Clarke's
,hnfwer to the 4th letter) exist under thatsormality no where
but in tlte Minu, neither have they any other foundation, nor
can they be a proofof any thing, beside that power which the
mind nas· to form them.

If the nature of Mix'd Modes and Relations were sufficiently
attended to, I believe it would not be afferted that our ldeas
of Goodnefr‚ Wisdom, Power‚ &a are all inadequate
an only negative. - that all our knowledge of these Per·
festinus ie impwper, iodim& and only analogical‚—--and
that the whole kind, nature, Effenre and Idea uf them is en·
tirely different when applied to God from what it is when pre·
dicated of hir Creatutes. Whereas these being arbitrary corn-
binatiohe of Ideaa made without regard to any particular Sub·
je& in which they may iubere, they are evidently their own
Archetypes aud therefore cannot but be adequare and ppltive:
They are what they are immutably and nniversally3 their Na·
rum and Efflnres must be the fame wherever they are found,
or te whatfoever subject we appi them, fo long as the same
number of Ideaa are included under the same word3 and no·
thing more is requifite than that the ldeas thur put together
be consistent to make all our knowledge concerning them, real,
ἔφηὸ, gredi, adequare and universal. See Locke, B.IV. C. iv.

lhall trouble the Reader no further on this Head than only
to obferre that the method of forming general ldear [which
our Author had advanced in his first Note, and which is since
used by the Author of Procedure, tre.) by making the ldea of
'one individual stand for the whole Species, muli be wrong on
this very account, viz. that accordin to the forementioned
‘scheme Unioerfials‚ such aa Animal or arrer would haveareal
Eristeuce in the same precife manner in which we confidet
them; whereas under such Precisrons they are confeffedly the

creaturea of our own Mindr and exist no where else. We have . '

nothing at all to do therefore with Analogy in forming Abstra&
ideas, we can never corne at them by substituting one particu-
