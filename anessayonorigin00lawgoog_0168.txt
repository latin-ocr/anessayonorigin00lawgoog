'very End for which they were invented: For he is

no less culpable who created any thing which he
-· knew wouldbe rendered miserable by another, than
if he had made that which he foresaw would
. bring Misery upon itsels. If therefore God might,
’ consistently with Goodness, create Things which he
, knew the Evil Principle could and would corrupt,
as the Manicheam asserted, then he might, con-
srstently with the same Goodness, have created
Things that would corrupt themselves, or were to
· perish in a Trafl of Time. If then, according to
the Defenders of this Hypothesrs, God ought to
have omitted, or not created those Beings, in whose
Natures Evil ,or'Contrariet‘y ss inherent, he ought
also to have omitted those, whose Natures he fore·
. saw the Evil Principle would corrupt. And isthere
was so much Good in these, as made him think it
· ’ better to create them, though they were to be cor·
, rupted some time or other by the oppofitc Princi-
ple, he might also judge it preferable to produce
the same, though they w'ere at length to perish by
- ¹ their own inherent Evils. Nor will God be forced
. to tolerate Evil in his Works more according to the
·. lisanicheans, than the Catholics. For as he might
have not made those Beings which have Evils ne„
' cessarilyadhering to them, lohe might also have not
made those which he foreknew the contrary Princi-
ple would corrupt. After the same manner in both
Cases he would have prevented Evil, and fince he ι
· could, -why did he not? The Supposition of two
. Principles conduces nothing at all therefore to the
= Solution of this Difficulty. (B.) ·
