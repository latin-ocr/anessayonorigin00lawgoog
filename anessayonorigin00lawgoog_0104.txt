36 Concerning the Origin of Evil. Chap.l.

'our own Existence, we form our Belies os Space also

as 'necessarily existing, since it is conneoed with

the Conception of Bady, i. e. of ourselvas. ,,
saell, XIV. Secondly, It is remarkable that theCon·

T²st⁶2 ceptions which we have from hearing, smalling, or
Hearing, tasting, tho' they be produced in us by external*

itself upon us. Now as the common People at-

tribute Smells, Tristes, Cohors, and other senstble
Qalities to the Ob'edls themselves, and believe

that they exist in tdem3 while they who attend

only in the Mind, and are nothing in the things by

'which they are produced, beside the peculiar Mo-

'tion and Texture of their Parta, after the same
manner, ’tis probable‚ we are-imposed upon in
attributing necessary Existence to Space, because

we observe that almost all our Thoughts are pro.

duced in us from without, and thereby accustom-

ing ourselves to join Space with them, while we

are conscious that we think, we conceive also that

Space exists·, Whereas, ifwe remember that ‘all

our Sensations, even those produced by external
Things, such as Smells, &a do not bn‘ng along

with them the Notion os Space, we may easily

lay assde this Prejudice, and withdrawing our

· Thoughts from the contemplation of Space, may

conceive it not to be.-
