concerning the Criterion ofVirtue.

THE Criterion of any thing is aRule or Measure by ,
αβοηῑοηηὶῖγ with which any thing is known to be
of this or that sort, or of this or that degree. And in order
to determine the Criterion of any thing, we must first know
the thing whose Criterion we are secking after. For a Mea·
sure presupposes the Idea of the thing to be measurari, other·
wisc it could not be known (since what is the proper Mea-
{ure of one thing is not so of another) whether it was fit
to measure it or no. Liquids, Cloth, and Fleih, have all
different Masone, Gold and Silver different Touchstones.
This is very intelligible, and the Method of doing it ge-
nerally clear, when either the Quantity or Kind of any
partinrlar Substance is thus to be ascertained.-

But when we extend our Enquiries after a Criterion for
abstra& mixed Modo, which have no Existenoe but in
our Minds, and are so very different in different Men 3 we
are apt to be confounded‚ and search after a Measure ¹for
we know not what. For unless we are first agreed concerning
the thing to be measured, we ihall in vain expeti to agree in
our Criterion of it, or even to understand one another.

· But it may be said, if we are exaffly agreed in any mix-
ed Mode, what need of any Criterion? or what can we want
farther? What we want farther, and what we mean by
the Criterion of it is this; viz. to know whether any infe-
