our Enquity will he, how we ihall know this ot that less
{laterai or particular Aetion to be comprehended undet

irtue. For unless our idea ofVirtue is fixed, we enquioe
afterthe Criterion of we know not what. And this out '
Idea of virtue, to give any Satisfadiion, ought to be so · ·
herai, as to be conformable to that which all or most eo
are supposed to have. Andthis general Idea, Ithink, may
bethus expreffed. '' '

Virtue is the Conformity to. a Rule os Life, direiling the

Aditus of all rational Creatores with respui to each other’s .

Happiness3 to which Conformity every one in all Cases isph-
h‘ged .· and every one that does so conform, is or ought to be
approved of, estemed and lived sor so doing. What is here
expreffed, 1 believe every one, or most, put into their idea
of virtue.

For Vitttte generally does imply some relation to others:
where Sels is only conoemed, a Man is called prudent, (not
virmoetgskand an Adtion which mittes immediately to God.

Ithink ἕο that dl Men, whatever they make Virtue to
mnfistbatm’ yet always make it to impiy Obligation and

ro ton.

Apihe Ideo of virtue being thus fixed, to enquire after the
criterion of it, is to enquire what that Rule of Life is to
which we are obliged to conform ; or how that Ruie is to be
fotmd out which is to direct me in my Behaviout towards
others‚'whid1.ought always to be ptosuod and which, if
putsued, will or ought to procuro me Approbation, Etim,
