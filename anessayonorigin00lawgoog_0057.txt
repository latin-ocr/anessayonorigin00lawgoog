On Morality and Religion. xlix.

ggmcrrlar Aetion immediately from a Consideration of the
ill of God, in order'to make it acceptable to him : lt may,
it is hoped, be sufficient, if we have ageneral Intent of ser-
ving him in the whole of any considerable Undertaking,¹
and an express Regard to him whenever he appears to be

more immediately concerned in any Part of it. Our im· ·

perfedt Understanding will not allow us to trace up every ,
thing to out ultimate End ·, we find it necessary therefore
to fix several inferior and subordinate oneo, wherein we are
forced to acquiesce, both in our Knowledge and our Prac-
tice 3 and it ‘is sufficient to recommend and justify an Ac-

tion, if it can be fairly deduced from any of these subordi- ’ ’

nate Ends, and have some conneuion or other with what
ismanifestly our Duty. Nay farther, some Adions which
are diredted to no distinet End at all, though in themselves
indeed they be no proper Subjects of Reward (as was ob·
servod) yet they may become such by virtue of certain
Habits, whereof they are consequences, and for which Ha·
bits we are properly accountable: and the Reason of this
is evident. As we cannot have ουτ main End constantly
in view, it is necessary, for us to acquire such Habits of
abling as may lead us almost insensrbly to it, and carry us
on. our Journey, even when we are not thinking of it.
These Habits therefore, if they be rightly founded and di-

reeted, must intitle us to a Reward or all the several Ac- ”

tions' which flow from them, even when the first F ounda· -

tion is forgot. Thus aServant sufficiently deserves both

he have acquired such Habits ofennstant Diligence in his
Master's Busmess, as will carry him regularly through it,
though he seldom confider the End of all his Labour, or
think of his Master in it.

E have, in two former Papers, considered the true
End of human Adiions, and the Means of attaining
it. We have laid down the only adequare Rufe or Criterion
of Morality, as also removed some of the false and insuffi-

cient ones usually proposed. {Ille have inquired intobglge
