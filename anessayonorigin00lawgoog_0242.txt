› Concerning Nature! heiu Chap. IV.

“ exercise themselves in amore noble manner, may

not the infinite Goodness of God be conceived to ·
have almost compelled him not to refiue or envy'

· ¹those the benefit of Life? Some of this kind were

to be created, fince there was Room left for them
in the Work of God, after so many others were
made as was convenient. But you ma wilh that

’ some other Place and Condition hadf en to yout

Lot. Perhaps so. But ifyou had taken u ano·
ther’s Place‚ that other, or some elle, mu have

been put into yourS, who being alike ungratefirl to
the Divine Providence, would wilh for the Place .·

= which you haye now occupied. Know, then that it

was necellary that you ihould either be what you
are, or not at all. For lince every other Place

and State'which the System or Nature of Things
allowed was occupied by some others, you must of

, necelsrty either fill that which you are now in, or

be banilhed out of Nature. For do ou expe&
that any other lhould be turned out oty his order,
and you placed in his room? that is, that God
lhould'etlhibit a peculiar and extraordinary Muni-
ficence tpward you to the prejudice of others. You
ought therefore not to censure, but adore the Du
vine Gmdnds for making you what you arc. You
could neither have been made otherwise, nor ina
better mannen but to the Disadvantage ofsome

v others, or of the whole. .,
