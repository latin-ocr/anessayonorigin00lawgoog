that there is no real Existencies strictly conformahle to this
our manner of conceiving them, i. e. in General. For -if ei·
ther these general Terms llood for things really exilling under
such a Precifron, or this our way ofconceivmg things were
fixed by Nature, neither of them would be so various and un-
certain as we find they are. The end of making thefe Ge·
seralfhnceptions is to range things into Seres for the convenience
uf Language. The manner of acquiringthem is as follows.
We are at first only acquainted with particular Substances ς
hut observing that as these particular Substances differ in some
respeels, lo theya ree in others, (i. e. though this particular
excites in the mind some iimple ldea or ldeas, which another
does not, yet there are sonte Ideas excited equally from both)
we take no notice of those ldeas in which two or more parti·
colar substantes differ, but select those only in which they

which itis affirmed‚ &a are said to be contained under that
General Idea. General Ideas of Substances therefore are not
made by addin all or any of the particular ldeas found in each
Substance, or y that rehned method, which the Author of
the Procedure imagines, of adding and omitting thern at the
fame timet but only by leaving out all those ldeas in which
two or more particular Substances differ, and retaining those
in which they agree. And from general ldeas thus made we
proceed to more general ones in the same way, viz. by al·
ways dropping the particulare wherein they differ. Thus ob·
seraing a certain agreement among Indiuiduals and omitting
the rell, we form an ldea ol the several Species. ln lilce ntan-
ner leaving out the distinguifning marks of each S ies, we
getan Idea of the Genus, luch as Man, Beast, or o ahigher
Genus, such as Animal .· and again by dropping that hy which
Animals are distinguilhed from all other things we acquire
the still more general or partial, Idea of Being or Substance.
When any one ol these eneral ldeas is found in a particular
thing it rs called the Efence of that thing: Effence therefore
is only that general abstrsft idea in the. Mind by which we
damnine-any thing to be ol this or that sort, which sort we
signify by such ageueral name as Animal, or Matter. So that
