r'o, andan Indieation of his Will3 wherein its Worth con·
faiis, and from whence it derives its Power of obliging.- r
And therefore to set afide the Deity in the Confideration
of Virtue, must be to relax it from its true Principle to
take it off its only Foundation: and to endeavour to exalt
Morality into an Independency on his Will, is to under-
mine and destroy it. Any other Principle but this, will either
comefhort ofthe Mark‚ or carry us from it. ·

- ‚Thus they who teach that Virtue is to be praclis'd for
ita native Loveliness and intrirfic Warth‚ must either af·
firm that it is lovely and valuable they know not for what, ’
, or why ς i. a. have no diffinit ldeaa to these fine Words 3·

or must mistake the Means for the End. Virtue, we find,

islovely for its good Effefts, and truly valuable on account
'of the Consequcnces that will certainly attend it, either by
the Laws of Nature, or pofrtive Appointment; therefore
they will call it lauch in itself‚ or absolutely so; and tell us it
is to be pursued purely for its own scale, and exclufively of

all the aforesaid Consequences·, i. a exclufively of every ⁵

thin that is good and valuable init.

They who follow Virtue for the immediate Pliasure
which attends the Exercise of it, must either take it for
alell‘lhhhhlllhlhlahlllll illle
to what is Rjght, (all which is as false as F aa can make it)
or elfe they praefice Virtue for a Reason which is common

tn any other Partica and will equally lead them to any», Α ’

aMotive which accompanies every strong Perfuafron or set-
tled Habit of Mind, whatever may be its future unfore·
seen Consequences. To do what either our Judgment ap-·
proves, or we have chose and set our Hearts u n, -will
give us this immediate Pleasure in any Course of ife3 ef*
pecially in one which we can purfue without external Dis..
nubance, or which happens to have the Vogue of the Place,
or Esteem of our Aequaintance, to encourage and confirm
us in our Ptuftrit. · ’ -
· They who describe Virtue to be following Nature, go

upon a Principle near akin to the foregoing, and full as'·
bada Forif oureNature as far as it concerno Mortis, be
in'a great measttie of, our own making, as, we haveRea·
