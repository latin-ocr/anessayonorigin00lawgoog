After all, it must be again consessed, that the Idea orsu:

cessron (as Mt. Colliber observes) so infinuates itsess into our Idea

ι of Existence, and is fo closely connected with the Existeuce os
all snite Brings, that we find it extreamly difficolt to imagine
the Eternas Existence of God, any otherwise than as an Eternal
continued Series or Successon.

Our constant Conversation with material objecto makes it
almost impossible sor us to consider things abstrasted from Time
and Place, which (as was observed before) are Modes of the
Existence osmelt things, an‘d therefore we are apt rashly to ap-
ply these Considerarions to the great Author and Preserver osasl
Τ hings. We seem to think that as the most exasted Idea we
can form os God’s Eternity and Omni-presence must be infinite
Duratiun, and unbounded Exteufiuu, so these are to be strisssy
and positivesy attributed to him; whence musi sollow all the ⁴
Absurdities of Past und Future, Extensrou sorbis and tbut Place

proach to it. (Though such negative Infinity=as belongs to all
Quantity cannot possibly be considered otherwise’rl So that
whosoever acknowledges God's Perseciions to bestrisily irfiur'te,
does by that Confessiom deny that they rnay be considered ue
