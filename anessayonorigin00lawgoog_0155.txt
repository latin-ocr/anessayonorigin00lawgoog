REMARKS.

Ι rothly‚ Who can tell the Nature and Effeuce os any thing
any farther.than he knows the Manncr os its' Existence? ibid.
Answ. The Nature or =Irssirrce of any Quaiity according
to ut, ie only ite abstrudi Idea, or that which determines it to
be os thie or that Soet, which must be the same in what Man-
,ἐξ ξων it existe, or ia exhibited in any particular snbjee.

,“ rrthly. But the soregoing Diffinetion supposes a real dis·
sereneo between 'these two, and that a thing has not such a
Mam os Existeuce because it is os suchat Nature, nor is os such
ι Nature because it has sucha Manner of Existence. p. 72.
Answ. No more it is, in our Sense of the Word Nature.
Koowiedge does not come by Sensation or Resiedhion in parti-
colar because it iaKnowledge, nor is it therefore Knowiedge
. because it comes by Sensation or Refiestion. 'Goodnesn Purher,
&a areos the same general Nature in Men and Angels, tho'
they be more imperfesily displayed in theone than in the other ς
which can arise only sronr the different Capacitiea os the snb,-
joes that receive them; or in other words, from the different
manner of their Existence in those Subjeeite which Manner is
therefore entirely independent on their abstraeh Nature, nor have
they any relation to each other.

rzthly. He must shew that the Manner of Understanding‚ ·

Wll or Pewer in God and Man is not at all owing to
the Nature of Understanding, Will or Prwer in God or Mun.
p sinivi. The Manner os these Qalities may be supposed to
b'e very different. and yet the Nature os them (in our Sense of
that, Wor'd) will continue the same„ which sstews sufficiently
that the sormer is not owing to the latter. , Is Will be defi-
ned a Pewer of Proferring οι· Chooysngr is not that the same
whatever it prefero, or however it¹ be rnovednso to doi Whe-
tbet it choose Good or Evil, whether it be determin‘d by
Anxiety or the last Judgrnent, or nothing atall? is Power be
an ubilin to produce Chunge, is not that thesaure whether it be
done in Thought or Marion, whether it be attended with Plea-
[κη or rain? ls Understanding bea Confisousness offirmthr'ng.
ianot that the same whatever the manner be in which it is ac-

uired, exercised, or exilis? Isit moneor less Undenlsanding
ior being got by Dedueiinn or immediate intuition, by Eyes or
Earn, or any other Way ἓ

r3tbly. The Difficulties charg'd upon the Dosirine os An· -

αἰσχ) are the same in the other Acconnt, which says that the
Divine Attribotes are different in the, Manncr os their Exist-
ence from the Qualitr'esof Men. For if they differ infinitely
ind immutab& in their Manner os ExNeoce, are wc not as
much at a loss to know what they are, and as unable to imitate
that which stende at an iniria} and immutalrse distance from ur,
