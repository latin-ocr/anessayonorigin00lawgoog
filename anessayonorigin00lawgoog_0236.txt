Concerning Natural Evib Chap. tv,

VII. Neither are Earthquakes, Storms, Thunden
Deluges and Inundations any stronger Arguments
against the Wisdom and Goodness of God. These

are sometimes sent by a Just and gracious God for
the Puniihment of Mankind; but osten depend on
other natural Causes, which are necessary, and

’ could not be removed without greater Damage to
. the whole. These Concuffions of the Elements are ·

indeed prejudicial, but more Prejudice would arise
to the Universa] System by the Absence of them.
What the genuine and immediate Causes of them
arel dare not determine: They seem in general
to derive their Origin from the unequal heat of
the Sun, from the Fluidity, Mutability, and Con·
trariety of thingS. To these we may add the
Asperity and Inequality of the Earth's Surface,

If it were of a Cubic, Prismatic, or any other Angular Figure,
it would neither be so capaciores sor Habitation, nor so fit sor
Mation, nor so commodiousfor the reception ofLiglst and Haut,
sor the Circulation os the Winds, and ¹the Dislribution of the
Waters; as is obvious to any one that is acquainted with the
first ¹Elementa os Natural Philosophy, and is at large demon·

diurnal Motion were stopprd, retarded, or accelerated, the usesul
and agrteable Viciffitudes of Summer and Winter, Day and
Ni ht, would tease‚ orat least cease to be so usesul and agree·
absc as they now· are. The immoderate Length or Shortness
of the Seasons would prove pernicious to the Eartb, and the
stated times os Business and Repose would be as incommodioue
to its inhabitants3 as disproportionate to the common Affairs
of Life, and the various Exigences os Mankind. ΙΙ Ἡ, in the

inconveniencies will attend the Polar Parte: lswe destroy the
Parallelism os it, besides destroying at the same time the useful

worse Consequences. A Description os some sew of them from
