pyrrh ἒιέις but the Understanding separates those things by

’ Refledtion, which the Sight hed conveyed to the

mind collesiively For rt perceives that the Wax

from round it be turned into square, from hard and
red, into sost and black. From whence it appears

that all these Properties are extrinstcal to it, but that ·
which continues under all these Changes is called its

Nat ture and substance

,The first III By Substance Ι here understand a thing
diist ¹⁶¹¹· which the Mind can conceive by isses as distinbi
⁰¹¹ ’ΜΩ and separate from all others: For that Thing, the
⁶ οοζκεοιῗ Conception of which does not depend upon another,

' snstble nor include or suppose any other, is to us a Sub-
ἐξ l ¹ ¹¹3stance and accordingly we distihguilh ιι by that
yffi “⁵'3Name But that which imphes dependence ,ιιι its

¹ conception we call aMo οι Acciderat For
instance, we can conceive a certain portion of
matter, such as WaX, setting assde all others, and
also without any particular Figura: But we are
not in like manner able to conceive an parri
cular Figure without matter. Wax thereshre is a·
Subsana, sor our conception represents rt as di
ytinrr, dihided from, and independent of all other
things: Νοι 1s it necessary to the knowledge
thereos that we join the couceptions of other
things when we think of rt: sor the conceptions os
that and these contributa nothing to, nor stand ιιι
