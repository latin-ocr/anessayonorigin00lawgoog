so on ς and at last shall find no other support sor the whole
but the cause which produced it. Malacha though he 'gave
into this way of talking yet he has sufficiently shewn his
dislike of it in ur. C.4. §.r8. B.2. C.13. §.t8‚19‚20.
and C. 23. §.23. and elsewhere*. Dr. Watts is of opinion,
‘that it is introducing a needlese Scholastic Notion into the
‘real nature ¹of things and then fancying it to have a real
‘Erlsslence’ Logfc p.14 The Author df the Praeclare, Extant,
dre. affirmo, ‘that as sar as we direflly know the essentias
‘Properties of any substance, sofar we have a anea know·
⁴ ledge of the Substance irself5 and if we had a direct Know·
'‘ ledge of all the essentias Properties of any substance, we
‘should have an adequare knowledge of that Substance3 for

any thing an Em or Being; the latter that which makes it a
Beingos this or that Sorr: Of which below. ¹

ln short, whatever is underslood by this word substancee

it cannot as Mr.Locle observes‡ be applied to God, Spirits

and Body in the same fense; and there
this and the like doubtful Ternas to subjens os a very dif-
ferent nature (especially that of substratum, which more ap-
parently confines our thoughts to Body) must needs occasion
Error and Consusron.

But though our Autbor's notion os substance be very de·
fensrble‚ he has applied the word Marter to the ldea os Bady,
whereof l atter is only 'a partial Conception containing no·
thing ntor, than the Idea of a solid Substance which is every
where the frume. These tw'o terms therefore cannot be put one
sor the other,x as Malacha observat though indeed they are
often used promiscuoussy.

Upon this occasion it may not be impro r to observe that
the various signification of these general etms Mutter, Sub-
stance, Efflnce, &e will serve to convince-us iu the first place,
that these words don't denote the manner how things really ⁴
exist, but only our manner os conceiving thern, arrd secondyyg '
