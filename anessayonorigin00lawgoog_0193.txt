Beings‚

who does not see what way the Divine Goodness wou’d
incline in this Debate? For fince it was better that these lhou’d
be, than not, isit not agreeable to infimie Gondness to choose
the best? At least such a Choice could beno Injury to the
greatest Goodnefs. .

Whttever System God had cholen, all creatores in it could
not have been equally perfesl, and there could have been but t
certain determinate Multitude of the most Persesl, and when
that was compleated, there wou'd have been aStation forCrea·
tures less perfert, and it wou’d slill have heen an Inflance of
Goodnefs to give them a Being, as well as others: And
therefore whatever Sysiem had been chosen, it would have
corneto what we see, perhaps it wou'd have been worse. Since
therefore whatever God had cholen, there must have been De-
grees of Perseslion, and one Creature must have been more
imperfesl and infirm than another, ought we not. to conclude
that our present Syllenr is at least equal to any other that we
could have expesledt

Hence it appears why God created such Beings‚ as must
necessarily have an Intercourse with each other, and how a·
greeable it was to the Divine Goodnefs not to deny them Ex·
isence. There could be no reason to asle why he did not
make thern of amore perfesl Order, frnceas many of that
Kind are rnade already as the Syllem could receive, os what
Kind soever that System were supposed to be. Neither could
the Benefit of the whole be render’d absolutely, in all Cafes,
and at all times consistent with that of Particulars. For tho’
this might perhaps be effeeled in the more perfest Orders, yet

lerated: Supposrng always that their Existence isa Blefsrng
to thern notwrthslanding these inconvenientes, and that more
Good than Eril accrues to thern from the Polleflron os it.

From hence it will appear how fruitful a Source of Evils
this Imperfeslion os Creatores may be, and that from this
Head there flows a Possibility of Evil among the Works of
God, notwithstanding Infinite Power and Goodness. How
every particular Evil ma be reduced to this Origin, lnatt be
shewn (God willing) in tile Sequel. Ι

ln the interim who can doubt whether this Source of all

hvils be itself to he call'd an Eril? Eril is by many hefifdd
