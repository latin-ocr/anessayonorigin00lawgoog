xxxviii Pleliminary Dffrtationss* ’

,dence' of our Maker in implanting the immediate Powers of
tlnese Approbations (i. e. in Mt. Hutcheson's Language, a
, norat Sense) and these Public Affeuions in us, than give

any satisfaelory account of their Origin. And· therefore =
these Pubhc Affeclions, and this Moral Sense, are quite ina· ’

dependent on private Happiness, and inreality a& upon us
as mere lnffinets. · v

The Matter of Fau containedin this Ayyument, in my
Opinion, is not tobe contested·, and ther ore it remains
either that we· make the Matter of *Fael consistent with
, what we have before‘laid down, or'give up the Cause.

Now, in order to rh'ew this Consistency, l beg leave to
observe, that asin the purluit of Truth we do nut alwaye
trace every Proposrtion whose Truth wc are examining, toa
first Principle or Axiom, but acquiesce, assoon as we per· ’
ceive it ’ deducible from some know'n or presumed Truth3
so in our Conduet we do not always travel to the ultimate
End of our fictions, Happincss: but rest contented, as soon

firmly adhered to as the Consequences of real truths or ar- ’
’ guments3 and¹ what is subservierit toa >false (but imagined)
means of Happiness, is as industrioussy pursued as what is
subservierit to atrue one ‘

Now every Man, both in his Pursuit after Truth, and
inhis Conduu, has settled and fixed a great many of these ’
in his Mind, which he always¹ ‘acts upon, asupon Primi· ’
ples, without examining. And this is oceahoned by the ·
Narrowness of our 'Understandingsz We can confidet but
a few things at once, and therefore, to run every thing to'

s the Fountain-head would be tedious, througha long Se:

ries of Consequences; to avoid this'we choose out' certain
Truths and Means of Happiness, which welook upon’as·

· RESTlN G PLACES, which'we may safely acquiesce

in, in the Conduet both of our Understanding and· Prac-

tice 3
