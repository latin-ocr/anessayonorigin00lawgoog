NOTES.

(τι) From the Supposition os a Scale of Beings gradually
descending hom Perfellion to Non-enrity, and compleat in every
intermediate Rank and Degree [for which see Note 24.] we
shall soon perceive the Absurdity os such Qestions as these,Why
was not Man made more persesli Why are not his F aculries
equal to those of Angels? Since this is only asking why he
was not placed in a quite different class of Bcings‚ when at the·
same time all other Classes are su posed to bc already full.
From the same Principle also we gather the Intentos the Cre-
ator in producing these several inferior Orders under our V iew.
They who imagine that all thinps in this World were made
sot the immediate Use of Man a one, run themselves into in-
extricable Difficulties. Man indeed is the Head of this lower
Part of the Creation‚ and perhaps it was designed ro be abso-
lutely under his C'ommand. But that all things here tend di·
reetly to his own use, is. [think. neither easy nor necessary
to be proved. Some manifestly serve sor the Food and Support
of others, whose Souls may be necessary to prepare and pre-
serre their Bodics sor that Purpose‚ and may at the same rime
be happy in a Consciae-listi} of their own Exislcnce. 'Tisbpyyy
