There is indeed a certain use of the term infinite among Ma7
thematicians, where'this reasoning os Dr. Clarle's might be
admitted, but that is only where they· confidet· Quantitles re-
latively, and not absolute] , and therefore that can heve no
lace where we are consrsering real Exiliences. Thus when
cometiicians say that one Qantity is infinitely less than a·
nother, they mean that their infinitely small Qantity is· no
aliquot part of, bears no proportion to, or cannot be compared
with the others but proportion is (nothing real but) purely
relative, and therefore the term infinite apply'd here must bo ο
too. Thus for instance, theAngle os Contu& madeby a Curvo
and its Tangent is infinitely less than any reflilinear Angley

any ways be compared with it. But this is nothing to vInli-
nity in the Senle in which Dr. Clarke has used its· since by
that he must mean some determinate thing, somethin of which
real Existence may be predicated‚ which is very dihirent from
Infinity in arelative Sense‚ as it is sometimes considered by
Mathematicians; or in a progreffive and indefinite one, which
is the Sense in which it is applied to Quantitios inereafing ordez
creafing without ends and therefore what relates to these ln-
finites cannot ¹be the Foundation of any Argumentconccrning
the other. The equivocal Use of the W ord Irfinite. in these
