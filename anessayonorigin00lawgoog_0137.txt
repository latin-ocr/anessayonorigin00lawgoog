REMARKS.

Beinge were entirely the same, ΙΙ grant it would be ne easy to
suppose allos them existing without a Cause, as One. But here
I think lies the Differencer There wan a time when all os them
eittept one, were indifferent either to existence or non-existence}
were nothing. Therefore for thern that were once indifferent to
exa‘ysencc ot non-exssence, tobe adiunHy determined into Exist-
ence, to be brought from nothing into something, or made what
they once were note is a real change, an aetion, an affin, and ao
suth, muli require some chan er, agent, cause. But on the other
hand, all that we know of iiis ane Being‚ is. that it now exryh
ond'always did so ;' that it never had a Baginning os its exist-
ence, wat never changed from what it is, never made or produc-
ed: nereis no effect, and therefore no reason nor roam sor n
