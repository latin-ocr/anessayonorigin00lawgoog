most Me'n that are used to Refiection, may 'remember the

Euty is generally defined to be that Pain which arises in ,

the Mind from observing the Prosperity of others a not of alt
others indefinitely, but only ofsome particular Persons. Now
the examining who those particular Persons whom we are “

apt to envy are, will lead us to the true Origin of this
llrllnofellolilrlllnnlllollaffhllihllllltcl'ilesl'ellll

tictlar Persona are always such as upon some account or o-

ther he has had a Rivalslip with.‘For when two or more ,

are Competitors for the same-thing, the Success of the one
must necessarily tend to the Detriment of the other, or others:
hence the Success of my Rival and Misery or Pain are join'd
together in my Mind; and this connection or affociation
, remaining in my Minu, even after the Rivalstnp ceases,'
makes me always affedied with Pain whenever I hear of his
Success, though in Affairs which have no manner of Rela-
tionto the Rivalihip3 much more in those that bring that
hllehsslill‘inlhlldlll ”llllllllwll {hill
cast some Light upon the black Desrgns and envious Pur-
poses ‚of the fallen Angels. For why might not they have
formerly had some Competition with their Fellows? and
why may not such Allociations be as strong in them as us?

Thus allo we are apt to env‘y those Persons that refuse to

be guided by our Judgemenu, and persuaded by us. For ’

this is nothing else than aRivallhip about the Superiority
of Judgmerit3 and we take a secret Pride both to let the '
Wyyld see, and in imagining ourselves, that we are in the

n t.
gThere is one thing more to be observed in answer to this
objection, and that is, that we do not always (and perhaps
not for the most part) malathis Affociation ourselves, but
learn it from others: i. e. that we annex Pleasure or Pain to ’
certain Things or Aelions because we see others do it, and
acquire Principles of Action by imitating those whom wo
admire, or whose esteem we would procuro: Hence tha
son too often inherits both the Vices and the Party of his
Fadaer, as wellas his Ellate: Hence National Virtues and
vices.
