when Neccffity of Existence has Relation to the Existence of
other things, it denotet that the Supposition of the Non-exist·
cnce of that thin of which Neceffity is affirmed, implies the
Non existence of things which we know to exist. Thus som'e
independent Being does neceffarily exist. because to suppose
no independent Being lmplies that thera are node ndent Be·
