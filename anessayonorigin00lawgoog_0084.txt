NOTES.

The learned Dr. Clarii endeavours to evade these Argumenta
about Parti, &e b denying that any Number of Years‚ Days,
and Houre: oro Miles, Yards, or feet, ‘can be considered
‘. aa any aliquot, or constituentparts of infinite sime orSpace, or
‘ lie compared at all with it, or bear any kind of proportion to

' ⁸ it, or be the foundation of any Argumcnt iu any Qreslion
‘ concerning it.’ Demonstr. of Dio. Artr. p. 37, 38. yth Edit.
But does not this look something like avoiding one great diffi-
culty by admitting a greater? For how do we coine at our
confused Idea of infinite uantity but by first hartinga clear
ldcaos some certain partes that uantiwa iu Spart, for in·⁸
stance, of sucha stated Len aaa ort ς insitire, osan Hour,
and then by duubling, treb ing, or any wav multiplying that
saure Idea aa long aa we please, aud still lindin as much tuoni
for or possibility of multlplyingBit ar we did when we he us
deterreamini. Μ. ut does tlris Idea of I 'to

(which seems to be the only one tlie Doelor ever thought of)
when applied to Time or Spart, alter the very nature, efferret„
aud idea of that Time and Space? Do not we still consider it
as au infinity of thesanu Time and Spacer or aa consisting in a
continual addibiliiy of such portione of Time and Spacer or aa

a While made up os number esa such parte of time and s ce aa
areos the saure kind with these houra and feet? To ay that
infinite Space has no parta, icas Leibnitz urges in liis¹ fourth
Letter to Di. Clarii, No. Xl. p. 99.) ‘ to say thatxit does not
⁶ cousist os huiteSpacer; and that infinite Spaee might subsist,
⁴ though all finite spaces should be reduced to nothing. It is
‘ aa isone should say, in the Cartestan supposition 01 a material,
‘ extended, unliniited World, that such aWorld might subsit,
‘ though all rh'e Bodies 01 which it confisis, should be reduced
⁴ to nothing*'. Ie is therefore impossible to conceive that hours
and sect, &a should not be aliquot parts 01 infinite Time and
Space, and that these parts should not bear some kind uf Pro·
portion to this Infinity. These parts indeed will never teach
our posteinie, 'absolute lifinite (i. e· that to which nothing cau
possibly be added) because they include a perpetual addibility,
as we observed‚ which is called their-Infiniry, and which is a
direti contradidion to what we call a positive Infinite: And
therefore positive infinity applied to them is falsly applied, and
a positive infinity of Matter, Number, Titne, Space, or any
quantity tharconsistr os parts, or must be considered iri succeffion.
