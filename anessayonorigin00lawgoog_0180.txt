therefore any one os these Organa could (as Ba lesupposes)
continue to communicate the sarne Degree os Plea ure to us sor

All-wisc Being‚ who cannot ast in vain, has implanted thia
Variety os Senses iu uss this then isa good Argument (to those
who allow such a Being, upon the Belies os which I am now
arguing) that none of these particular Senles could continue in

(aa Bayle maintains) so. close a Conneslion between ¹the Soul
and certain Modifieations os Matter, as that the Degrces os sen·
sitire Pleasures are diminishcd by a Change in the Organ, by
wealrening the Concullion os some parts of the Brain by frequent ,
Repetitionsr then we say, 'tis plainly irnpolhble that the same
Degrees should be continued by this Orgau, which, as it ia·
material, is perpetually exposed to this change, and liable to
Dissolution, and necessarily weakened by these frequent Cosa
eu rans. Every Motion in it must intime he hopped by
contrary ones, as our Authur has sully lhewn in Chapter 4.

· tf he supposes that the sarne Degrce 'os Pleasure rnay llill be

communicated tho' the Organ alters, he sup oses that there is
no such Conneslion between any Portion or defition os Matter'
aud our Spirit; which is diredtly contrary to his former Sup-
positiou, and also to truth, aswill perhaps appear from the sol-¹
luwing Chapter. ls then Bayle imagines that the santeaeor dis·
ferent Matres, when moued or at resta or when mored in dille·
rent Direslions‚ may still affert the Mind in the very sante nran-
ner, hc must either talne it sor granted that the Affeniors os
Matter are no Causea os the sentations of the Mind, that is,=
contradist his sormer Supposition; or else he mest suppose
the sante Esse& to proceed from different Causea ς either os
which will tend ually to advance hissystem. But in το·-
aliry, thia Decreae of Pleasure in Familiarity and Cuslont
does not perhaps entirely depend on any Change os the coru
poreal Organa, but on the original Faculries os the Soul it·
