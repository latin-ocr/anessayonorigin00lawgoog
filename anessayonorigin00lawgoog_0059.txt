also must come under the Notion of drusing Natural'Good:
No Moral Goodness in pursuing the trappa* before-mention-
ed, nor in carrying on any Trade for the Servioe of the
World; though without these T ' the World could not
litblist. Moral Goodness therefore 'es not in chufing the
greatest Natural Good‚ but in chufing any Natural Good‚
when not irnpelled to it by Neceffity, nor moved by present
Pleasure or Reward. Earing and Drinking is not Virtue,
because we do it to latisfy Hunger and Thirst‚ and to
please the Appetite: But the Virtue is in regulating and
moderati the Appetite, that that very Appetite which is
necessary or the Being of the World, may not be carried
to such an Excess as to disturb its well-being. The like
may be said of the rest.

The Case is the same in Acts of the most immediate be-
neficia] Tendency‚ whether they be directed to the Pub·
lick in general, to inferior Societies or particular Persons:
To defend, alsrst, relieve a Friend or Fellow-Citizen; to
serve and support him in his Credit or Fortunas, Body or
Mind: If this, which commonly goes by the Name of
Moral Goodness, proceed from sellilh Views, or no distinet ·
View at all; froma Prospedt of future Advantage in this
Life, or from the present Pleasure of performing it; it is
nothing. To preserve the Rights, Laws and Liberties of
our Country, to improve and reform awhole Nation, to
