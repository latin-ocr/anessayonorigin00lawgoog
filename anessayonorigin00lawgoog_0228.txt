imprinted in us hut by the sense we have of its Goodnese‚ and
then the 'Quarrel against God is, that he hus given ue so good
athing that we are unwilling to pert with rt, and chuse to
endure such paiusas tend to preserve it, and without which we
could not long enjoy it. Isis a most wicked thought to ima· ’
