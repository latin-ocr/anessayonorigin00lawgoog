⁴ Wherefore, once lofinr‘te is thelame with absolutely perfetta

⁴ we having a Notion or idea of the latter, most needs have ,
‘of the former. From whence we learn also, that though the
‘Word Iorfioite be in the F orm thereos , Negative, yet is tha
iSense of it, inthese things which are really capable of the
‘same positive, it being all one with absolutely perfida Aa
‘likewise the Scnse of the Word fluite is negative, it being
‘che same with supersell- So that finite is roperly the Ne-
1 ‘ gation of irfiaita as that which in order of nature is before
‘. it, and not Infinita the Negation of linita. However, in
‘these things which are capable of no true lifinity, because
‘the are essentially finite, aa Number, corporeas Magnitude,
⁴ ans ‘limes Infinity being therea mete imaginaty thing, and
‘ a non-entity‚ it cau only be conceived by the Negation of m-
‘, nite, as we also conceive Nothing by the Negation of Something,

, ⁸ that iu, we can have no pcfitive conception at all thereos. ΙΙ
Now, all this is not attempting to make the Attributes of
God postively infinite by superadding a Negative Idea of Itys-
nity to them: (as the Author >os the Praeclare dcc. justly ur·
ges against Mr. Locke, in B. 1. c. 3. p. 82. and the same might
with equal Jullice be objeficd to Dr. Clarke, when he applica
infinite Space and infinite Duration to the Deity, aud calls
· one his Immeorfity and the other his Eternity.) But it is mak-

removing from it all Poffibility of Want, or Deficilucy, Μίκωνα,
or Allaypas explained in the last Remark.

. [R'.m.] By the Word Justice, as it relates to Punilhment,
we mean the Exercise of a Right, or doing what a Person has
a Moral l'ower to da. Mercy implica his reading from that
Right, or not exerting that moral Power. When we apply
these Terms to the Deity‚ we consider his Dispensatioos in a
partial View, via. only with Relation to the Person ostend·
ang, and himself the offendeds or as mere Debtor and Credi·
tor, exclusive os all other deiuge, who ma be affeded there-
hy, and whom therefore we should su posi to be regarded in
these Dispensations. In this Sense these> two Attributes have a
distinet Meaning, and may both be always subordinate to
Goodness, but can never be repugnant to each other. Thus,
where a Creature has forfeited its Right to a Favour, or in·
curred a Penalty‚ by, the breach of some corenam, or the
Transgreslion of somehow, the Creator, considered with respeft
, tu that Being alone, and in those Circumstances, has always a
Right to withdraw the F avour, or to inflict the Penalty; and
' will prosecute that Rigor, whenever he finds it necessary to
ssme farther End ι But yet his Goodness may incline him often
to suspcnd or remit it, on some foreign Metire, viz. on ac-
count
