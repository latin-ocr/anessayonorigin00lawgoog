xit PREFACE.

⁵ the fittest means to that end, and worthy of a ‘G0d, Foy·
what ground is there to complain of the Deity in this

’ · whole affair3 except that when an equal lhare of happiness

could not befal every one, he bestows the best on such as
- use their faculties aright, and takes away what he had given
'from thole that abuse them? But more of this hereafter.
14· If what is laid down above be true, from thence 'tis
manifest that all kinds of Evil, viz. that of IMPER-
Fecr’JoN, PAIN, and SIN may enter into a world
made by the most wisegood and powerful Author‚ and
'that its Orioin may be accounted for without calling in the
assistance οῗ an Evil Principle. ·

· , ., 15. 'Tis plain that we are tied down to this Earth and

confined in it, as ina Prison, and that our Knowledge does
' not extend beyond the Ideas which we receive from the
Senses3 and who knows not how small a part we under-
stand even of those Elements about which we are conver·
sant? But snrce the whole Mass 'of Elementa is as aPoint
inre ard to the whole Universe, isit any wonder if we
‘ mist ewhen we are forming a judgment, or rather a con-
jeoure, concerning the Beauty‚ Order and Goodness of the
·Whole from this contemptible Particle? This Earth of
{llll ll liilllrll⁰lfliplllssh llllll {l
it is, there is much more both of Natural and Moral Good
'than Evil to be found init.

Thus far has the Controversy about the Origin of Evil
‚proceeded in the Author's Book. For all that hasbeen said·
above is either expressy contained in it, or may very ea'srly

r be deduced froin thePrinciples there laid down.

P. S. rae Perfims to whom I am more particularly obli'geal
for the Papers abovemenrionel are the Reverend Mr, Spence
Rellor of Donnaghmore, and the Reverend Mr. King Pre-
lendan os St. Patrickb and Minister of St. Bride’s‚ Dublin ε
who are destred to accept of this Aclrnowledgement, and to -

·. excuse the Freedom [here take of informing the Public, to
whom Ι asseem ir, as'well as nyseh‘ indebted.
