‘ The Qeliion theu will be, what is the Qause os its Exili-
⁴·encei Now that cannot be in itsesfi sor then a thing tatould
⁸ be before it was, which is a Contradittion. It follows then,

‘neat Quelilun will be, who ir this Beingi Now as whatever
⁸ began tu exist must owe its Exillence to sonte preceding Causea
‘stt that Cause, is ithae aut existed eternally, must likewise
‘owe ite Exillence tu some other preceding Cause, and that to
tauto, and so on till we ascend to (the first Carrst, or to) a
‘aBeiug that intrarat, and exilis absolutely without Cause.
⁸ aad t arrhene is such a Being is evident, otherwise, as no-
5 thing could be'gin tu exist without a Causc, so nothing that is
'aot eternal could ever have existed. †

· [R. e.] That the Idea of Seis-dedicate can imply. nothing
nore than a Negation osDeprndegnce'on any Causee and that

ruff& ffExistente can only be considered as aConsequence ·

resulting from such independence seems very clear. A Being
which is the hrsl of all Causes, ithls absolutely uncaused‚ can-
not hale any thing in any manner of Conception prior to it, or
witich may be considered as aposative Ground os its Exihence.
We can therefore only provehis Exislence a posteriori and ar·
e from the manner os it in a negative way. See Note 4.
the order of 'Causea we gather that he must necessarily
have been irem all Eternity, otherwise his Existence would hare

otherwise attend would be put to that Existeuce by nothing.
hrt ahia is till only a Consequentia! Necessrty arisrn srorn the
Absurdity which would attend the contrary Suppoiitions, and
do inser any thing frona hence concerning the Modus os the Di·
vina Being seems to be building a great deal morcon this Ar·
tumeat than it will bear. This is indeed a Recyon by which
tte tad that he muli always erist, but it is a Rea on to us only,
aud does not affe& bis own Nature, or the Cause of it, and
when it ie applyed to that, 1 think 'tis used equivocally. Con-
