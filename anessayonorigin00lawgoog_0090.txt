' youll say, what is eternal, stnce it was never made, '
requires no Cause.¹ Why so? Suppose the Sun to
have lhined srom Eternity‚ and the Barth, nourish-¹
ed by its Heat, to have undetgone eternas Vicilsrff-

no cause? Would they be ever the less dependent
on the Sun as their Source and Original? Hence '

ceived to have been from Eternity, that we must
rather say it has always been produced. For in tlte

, Instance given it appears that the Sun did always,
and from Etcrnity‚ cause the change os Seasons:
¹ Not that 1 think the Sun really was, or could be
eternas, but if Motion strould be supposed eternal
(which is the only Subterfuge left to them that
deny the Neceffity of an Agent, in order to the
Existence of Motion) the Sun might equally be, ·
eternal with its Light and their Effcsls. And is
this be granted, it will plainly appear, that Eternity ·
os Abiion does not exclude an Atlive Cause. Is then
we follow the guidance of our Thoughts, we must
acknowledge that there is something befide Matter ·
and Mation, which must be the Cause os Motion. 2
