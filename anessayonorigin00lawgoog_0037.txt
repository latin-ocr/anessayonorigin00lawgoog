he such. Here then we are got one Step farther, ortua
new Criterion : not to a new Criterion of Virtue immediately,
but to a Criterion 01 the Will of God. For it is an A'nswer
10 the Enquiry, How shall I know what the Will of God
in this particular is? Thus the Will of God is the immedi-
ate Criterion of Virtue, and the Happiness 01 Mankind the
Criterion of the Will of G0d; and therefore the Happiness
01 Μο11κ1111ί1ἰ rnay be said to be the Criterion of Virtue, but
once remoue .

And since I arn to do whatever lies in tny Power towards ’
promoting the Happiness 01 Mankind, the next Enquiry
is, what is the Criten'on of this Happiness: 1. e. How shall
l know what in my Power is, or is not, for the Happiness
os Mankind?

Now this is to be known only' from the Relations 01
things, (which Relations, with Respest 10 our present En‘-

uiry, some have cail’d their Fitnefs and Unfitness.) For
‘some Things and Adhons are apt to produce Pleasure, o·
thers Pain; some are convenient, others inconvenient for
aSociety 3 some are for the good of Mankind; others tend
to the detriment os it ; therefore those are to be chosen which
tend to the good 01 Mankind, the others to be avoided.

Thus then we are got one step farther, viz. rothe cri-
terion 01 the Happiness 01 Mankind. And from this Cri·
terion we deduce all particular Virtues and Vices.

' The next Enquiry is, How shall I know that there is
this Fitness and Unsitness in thin ? or is there be, how
null l discover it 111 particular C es? And the Answer is,
either from Frrperience or Reason. You either perceive the
Inc'onveniencies 01 sonre Things and Affions when they

hap n; or you sereser them by comtemplating the Nature .
01 eThings and Affions. ·

. Thus the Criteriou 01 the Fitness or Unhtness of things ,

,may in general be said to bc Reason: which Reason, when ’
exaffly conformable to the things existing, i. e. when it
Judges of things as they are, rs called Right Reason. And

hence alh w¹e sometimes talk 01 the Reajon of things, i. e.
'gwy ,speaking, that Relation which we should find our

our Reason, ir· our Reason was right. Th
