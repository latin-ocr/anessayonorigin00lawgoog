Το give this Argument its suli Confideration, 1 will examine

cipit. Idefire it may he considered, lst, whether any Mation,

whether the Pains do not serve as a Means to prevent it. And
if the Preservin our Being be a greater Good to ue than these·
Pnine are a Mishief, then it is plain 'tis better we hould hare
than went thern. But adhy, Pain seerns to be nothing else bnt

pereeive it to deeny, and not he diffleased with the Sense of
