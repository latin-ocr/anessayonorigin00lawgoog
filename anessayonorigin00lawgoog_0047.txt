tice ; in relation to theone, regarding them as Axiorns; in
the other, as Endr. And weare more easily inclined to this
by imagining that we may safely rely upon what we call
Habitual Knowledge, thinking irneedless to examine what
we are already satisfied in. And hence it is that Prejudices,
both speculative and Praetical, are difficolt to be rooted

out, viz. few will examine them. ⁶

And these RESTING PLACES are so often used ae
Principles, that at last, letting that ssip out of our Minds
which first inclined us to embrace them, we are apt to ima·¹
gine them not as they really are, the Substiruta· of Princi-
ples, butPrinciples themselves,

And from hence, as some Men have imagined Innate
ideas, because forgetting how they came by them; so o-

The Case io really this. We first percei've ot imagine
some real Good, i. e. fitness to promote our Happiness‚ in
those things which we love and approve of. Hence (as ,
was above explained) we annex pleasure to those things, ’
Hence thosethings and Pleasure are so tied together and as· ’
sociated in our Minds, that one cannot present itself but the

other will also occur. And the Afficiation remains even' ⁴

after that which at first gave them the connection is quite
forgot, or perhaps does· ndt exist, but the contrary. An
Instance or two may perhaps make this clear. How many
Men are there in the World who have as strong a taste'
for adonay as others have for Virtue·‚ who count so much
Money, so much Happiness; nay, even sell their Happi-
ness for Money; or to speak more properly, make the
having Money, without any Desrgn or Thought of using it,

their ultimate End? But was this Propensrty to Money ¹ -

born with them? or rather, did not they at first perceive
a great many =Advantages from being possessed of Money, Α
and from thence conceivea Pleasure in having it, thence
destre it, thence endeavour to obtain it, thence receive an·

aebalPleasure in obtaining it, thence desire to preserve the
