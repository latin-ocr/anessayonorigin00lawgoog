ralists, viz. What is the Principle or Motive by which
Men are induced to pursue Virtue.

For some-have itnagined that thetis the only Objesl of '
Choice toa rational Gutture, which upon the whole will

produce more Happness than Misery to the Chooser·, and ,

that Men are, and ought to be guided wholly by thisPrin-

p But this. however true in Theory, is nsufficient to ac-
count s0t Mater of Facl, i. e. that the generality of Man·

tion; and o, that some pursue it without knowing that

„ssd tint this is matter of F att, the ingenious Author
of the Enqui into the Ortginal of our Idea of Virtue has so
evidernly ma e appear by a great Variety of Instances, that
a Man must be either very little acquainted with the World,
or a men Hobbist in his Temper to deny it.

And therefore to solve these two Difficulties‚ this exr-¹
oellent Annos has supposed (without pruning, unless by
shewing the inhtfficiency of all other Schemes) a Moral
Sensc oo account sor the former, and a publick or benevolam
Affdlion fot the latter: And these, viz. the Moral Sense

and Public afferren, he supposes to be implanted in us ¹

like Insiinrls, indepurdent of Reason, and previous to any
numerian ; and therefore his Opinion is, that no account
can be given, or ought to be expested of them, any
ruore than we pretend to account for the Pleasure or Pain
which aises from Settsation; i. e. Why arry particular
Morion produced in our Bodies should be accompanied with,

Pain rather than Plealure, and vice verser. ἂ
