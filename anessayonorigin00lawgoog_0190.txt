are neither capable of Good nor Evil; it lignifies nothing Ι
where they are placed, or to what Moriens they are subjecied,
lirlce they cannot complain orbe sensible os their Condition.
Consequently there ii no such thing aa the Evil os serpentium,

To all which we answer ist. The World and every Part os
itis in its own Nature imperfect, for whatsoeveris naturally
perstet, is self sufficient, and does not stand iii need os the

Parts is not to be estimated from their own private Conveni·
ency alone, bur sroni the Relation which· they have to the

4rbly. The Good os the whole cannot be in every thing at
all times consistent with the Good os each Particular. For
aa every Part is in its own Nature imperfect and limited, ’tia

much Occasion for external Assistance as reason toaliist others.
'she Poffibility os such a State sollows from the very Nature
