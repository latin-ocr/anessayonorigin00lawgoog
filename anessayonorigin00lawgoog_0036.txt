be happy without doing or omitting that Action, then the ’
Agent is1said to be obliged to do or omit that Aetion. So'
that Obligation is evidently founded upon the Prospedt of
Happiness, and arises from that necessary lnfluence which
any herion has upon present or soture Happiness or Mis·
ery. And no greater Obligation can be supposed to be' laid

to the four different manners in which it is induced: First, ‘
that Obhgation which ariseth from perceiving the natural
Consequences of things, i. e. the Consequences of thingi
abling according to the fix'd Laws of Nature, may be
call’d Natural. Secondly, that arisrng from Merit or De·

that arismg from the Authority of the Ciwil Magistrate‚
Civil. Fourthly, that from the Authority of God, Religiour.
Now from the Consideration of these four sorts of Ob-
ligation (which are the only ones) it is evident that a full and
complete Obligation which will extend to all Cases, can
only be that arisrng from the Authority of God 3 because
God only can in all Cases make a Man happy or miserable:
and therefore, smce we are always obliged to that confor-
mity call’d Virtue, it is evident that the immediate Rule or
Criterion of it is the Will of God. But is the whole Will
of God the Criterion or Virtue? No. For though the whole
Will of God is equally obligatoty; yet, smce Virtue was

, defined to be the conformity to a Rule direffing my Be-

God can be no farther concem'd about Virtue, than as it ,
direets me in that Behaviour. . ’ ,

The next Enquiry therefore is, what that Will of God

Now it is evident from the Nature of God, viz. his be·
