REMARKS.

4thly. Is Power in ‘Man and Power in God are alike in Per·
station bot unlike in Defert, th musi be alike in Omnipotrncc·
but unlike in Defert of Power. bid.

Answ. Rather they must be alihe as sar aa theyaresrmply
Power, or agree in 'the general Idea os itt bnt unlike aa far aa
they arePower mix’d with impotenter or as the fflrercise of 'em
is attended or not attended with Uneaſsness. &e ·

ethly. What is alike in Perfeeion mnll be alike in Imper-
settion, unless athing nray be like another instrengtb, but not
like it in the want os Strength. p⁴ 70. .

Answ. May not a thing be lrke another in having stane
strength, tho' not like it in having the same strength? sure it
is no inconsrstency to say things are os the sarne Nature or Genus,
tho'inadifferentDegree. ’ .

61th That which differs only in Degree can only differ in α’
certain Degree but finite and irfinr‘te, mutable and immutable
can’t be said to differ only in a certain Degree. Ibid. .

Answ. An absolute ot metapbyfical Irfinite, which ia the

⁴ only one that can be applied in the present Cale, nepotiane
Idea of sorne certain Quality in the Abstra'tt, in the highest
Degree‚ or to which nothing of the sante kind canbeaddede
fince t'nen there ia a highest in all such Qralitiea a'a'Goodness,
Power, &e (contrary to what we lind in mathematical Qran·
rities) they may be said to differ in a certain Degree, see Rs
Mrpabilr'ry or Inmutability are nothing to these Qralitiea er
ur.
s 7thly. To say that they differ only in a Degree or Manner os
Existence supposes that Degree or manner of Existence srgnisy the
semething‚ whereas they are exceedingly different. Ibid.

Answ. Or, inheretaltendisjunttively. Tho’these two amount
to the sarne thing: A disserent Degrer always impliea adifferent
MannerosExillence. ,

8thly. The Eiritlence os God differs sronr the. Erillence os
Man in the Manner of Existence, bnt not in the Degree os Exin-
ence.. . r.

fagrshr.7Exislence is properly no Attribnte, nor isit capable
o e rees. .

9thlgy. Is their manner os Existence rnust hare all that Dis·
serence there is between finite and infinite, &o then it can srg·
nisy little whether you say they are different in their Nature
pkpdEffence, or only disserent in their Manner os Exillence.

r.

Answ. Let the Manner in which Dirine Knowledge enisa be
never so different from ¹that os human Knowledge, yet so long
aa it is Knowledge, or agrees in the general Idea with what
Men call Knowledge, it must lignisy something more thanis it
were totally diffluat, os quite another kind, and had no more
resemblance to it than Knowledge has to iner, as seems to be the
