the Benefits of Nature. Now 'tis to beesteetn’d
an H inest, and an Argument of the Divine
Goodn , thatthe Natural Benefits of Life can·
notbe taken from us, but Life is taken from us
also. Life then ean bea burden to none3 nor is
it necess'ary that any one ¹should withdtaw'himself
from naturai Evils by voluntarily putting an end
tohis Life. For if these Evils be such as take away
the Benefits os Life, they also b' it to an end.
God produced all things out of no ing, and gave
us Being without our Adviee; heseems therefore

which outweigh the Good, 'tis reasonable thet God
sstould remit osto our former State; that is, let us ·
return to nothing. Neither ought we to accuse the
Divine Power and Goodness, which has hestow’d an

affirm that God has not bestow’d upon us all the
Knowiedge that is agreeable to our State? We
ought therefore never to be deceiv’d about such
