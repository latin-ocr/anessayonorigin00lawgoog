lowance and Indulgence ought to be given to these Wri-

that particular Author which we are read’ used them.
And if a Man interpret the Writers of Mor 'ty with this
due Candor, 1 believe their seeming Inconsrstencies and
Dilagreements about the Criterion of Virtue, would in a
great measure vanilh; and he would find that abling agree·

, Good with the Wll of God.
But whether this Difference be real, or only verbal, a

’ have the Ideas of most particular Virtues, and alsoa con-
fused Notion of Virtue in general, before they have any
Notion of the Criterion of it·, or ever did, neither perhaps
can they‚' deduce all or any of those Virtues from their
Idea of Virtue in general, or upon any rational Grounds
