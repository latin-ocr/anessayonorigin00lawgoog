hi The Notuaeond obligations of Man,

’ ιι. Nor isit difficolt to find or form such a-Connodhiort²
srom what was hinted above, Reoson discovers it, as well
from the natural consequence of things ·, benevolent affec-
tions in each person being apt to generate correspondent
ones in others,⁴ and each beneficent ad to engage a return
os like good offices3 as from the positive appointment of
th'e Deity, who defi ns the common Happiness or per-
sedion of all rational Beings, according to the nature he
has given them, and‘the Circumstances under which he
has placed them; h'aving made them with no'other view
that we can conceive, than in order ¹to have this communi-
catedto them in the most effectual manner 3 and whomust
consequendy approve os every instance os their cooperation'
with him in the same design, and assuredly reward each re-‘
guhr course of Aetion in his Creatures that tends to pro-

mote it.

12. His will in this respedl is therefore the general Rule
or true Criterion of Morality, as what infallibly must, and
what alone can, effedually secure to us our ultimate End,
Happiness upon the whole; Happiness in some certain
State, above and beside the natural consequence os all our
virtuous Aus and Habits·, and who will in that State
make us most am le amends sor whatever pains we take
here, or whatever ihss and inconvenience we can possibly
undergo in prosecuting os them, and thereby makes such
prosecution an invariable Duty to us, or constitutes a per-
se& and perpetual obligation thereto.

13. The same thing may be either traced out thus by
Reason and demonstrated‚ or come at' in a more compen-
dious way, which yet will have equally strong and perma-
nent Effeds upon our Constitution, hay commonly more
sudden and more striking oneo, on which‘acconnt it is of-
ten mistaken for sels-evidence or intuition ι -I mean the

' wer of ASSOCIATION, which was just hinted at by
hdr. Locke, but a ply’d to the present purpose more direstly
by the Author olP the soregoing Differtotion‚ and from him¹
taken up and consider’d in a much more general woly by
