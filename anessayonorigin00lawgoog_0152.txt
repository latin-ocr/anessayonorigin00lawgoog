ΓΙ it he objetled here, that the Nature and Modus of any thing ·
rnull be the very farne, since by different Natures are only meant
different Manners οΙ Existeuce.

Ι answer: By the Nature of any thing, 1 understandits seve·
rol distin uisbin Proprrties. By the Nature of any Property
1 underlland idme certain pofitive Mark or Charatlrr which
distinguiIhes that property from any others. Thus, hythe
nature of Body‚ Ι mean, solid, divifible, figur'd and moveable

, Extensron. By the Nature oi Solidiry, 1 mean Refisteuce, or

a power of excludiug other Bodies out¹ of its place3 which
lllark sufficiently distinguishes it from Dwifibility, or any other

Α property belonging to thelame Body, as well as all the fore·

mention'd properties distin iih a Body from something else:
both which ue tnay there ore properly enough be said to per·
ceiv'e or bno-1123 tho' perhaps wemay never in like manner know
how these several Propertius are united together, aud come to
form one Aggregate or Substancer nor whence this Power or
Property of Refistence proceeds, or how it is caus’d, which is

-. “ what we understand by the Modus of each. So that knowing

or having a clear determinate Idea of a certain Thing ot Qra-
lity. {o as to be able to distinguilh it t'rotn another Thing or
Qality‚ and always perceive it to be really rhun is quite dif-
ferent from knowing how the said Thing or Quality comes to be
thou: How or why it is, areModes of Existence and differ plain-
ly from what it is, or what Idea we have of it, which denotet
its Nature or Efflnce.

horne objections having been made to this Rematk hyan
eminent Writerll, lihall here set down the sobtance of his
Argumenta, and what Ι take to be an Answer.

ln the first place, the learned Author would h‘ave it ohserv'd
thatin a comparison made between the Attributes of God and
those Qualities which we elleern Perietlions in ourselves, itis
affirm’d that they are of the same Nature or Efflnce, aad yet par!-
ly th'e same and partly dtffirent, p. 68.

Answer. Nature or Effrn'ce is only that which determinet the
Species of these Qalities‚ or denominatos them of this or that
δονεῖ thitmay bethelme, tho' they be different in another
sense oi the word Nature, i. e. as including every thing which

· does or may attend the whole of their Existenee. Thra Goodr'usr
