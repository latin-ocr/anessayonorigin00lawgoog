- When the Neceffiry os Existencearises from the Relation
which the Existence os any thing has to the Manner os ,its own
Exillence, then Necessrty means that that thing of which it

is affirm'd exista aster such a Manner that it never could have

not existed. 1 Thus every Independent Bring‚ or every being ex·

isting without a Cause, is necessarily existing. Because sucha
,Being srorn the very manner os its exisling, could not begin to

ercisl, therefore nun always have existed, ie. does necellarily

exill. For to suppose a Being to begin to exist, ia to suppoe

a Mearm, viz. srorn Non-entity to Entity 3 and ro suppose a
Metanira is to suppose a Causer For if there‘s no Caule, every

thing musi continue as it was. Theresore every Being-wbich

had no Causa os Exilience‚ i. e. which is independent‚ cannot

begin to erili,v consequently cannot be supposed not to exili,

not be necessarily existent in the former Sense, without being

latter Sense without being so in the sotmer. There rnay be
