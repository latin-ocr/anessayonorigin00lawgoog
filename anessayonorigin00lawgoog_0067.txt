able Writer has delivered conceming the true History of

the Human Mind‚ I fancya right Theory of Morals might

long ago have been laid down with more success; andin
particular we lhould have been satisfied that any such Prin·

ciple as will perpetually influence and effeetuassy induce us ⁸

to promote the Happiness of others absolutely and entirely
independent of our own, can never be wrought out of our
original Feelin 3 or spring from that primary and purely
native stock o our Ideas, on which are grounded all the
Tribe of natural Appetites, and the whole Fumiture of the
Human Mind. It must therefore either be superinduced by
Reason, in view of attaining out great End, as observed
above ; or come in under the Head of Affirciation‚ and by
way of Habit, without any ultimate End or distinct view at
all. Those of the other fide of the Qestion may chose
which of these two they like best.

any original pleasures or pains befide senfitive ones, how-

sore any innate intellectual determination, or Moral Prin-

can it constitute no other Class fundamentally different from
these, and much less opposrte to them, whatever alterations '
or improvements may be made amongst them: and the
Medicina Mentis will, like that of the Bady, be all composed
of the same sort of Ingredients, however mixed and altered
in the Composition. .

tf Mr. Locle’s plan were once rightly understood we
lhould have little room for any dispute about the different
natures of these two, or the distin& Principles that adluate
and govern them. We lhould soon find that all found Philo-
sophy in Marah is entirely built on Natural Philosophy, and

never to be separated from it. But we seem not yet to haftvle
