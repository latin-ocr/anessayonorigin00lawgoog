trl. broken, the Fluirls therein contained must necessarily
llow out, the circular motion must cease, and to-
gether with it animal Life. Such Animals there.
iore as have solid Bodies, are by Nature Mortal„
and cannot last for ever, without violence done to

the Laws of Nature, of Matter, and Motion. There
must then have been either none at all created, or
such as are naturally Mortal. The imperfectiori.
of Matter could not suffer it to be otherwise. For
the hard and solid parts belongin to these Bodies
are os such aFrame as must neoeslarily be shaken
and separated by others of the same bulk and hard-¹
nest. Every thing therefore that consrsts of such
