Galle rs contradted ιιι the taking away the Life of another
So that the Criterion of Murder, according to one or other
of these Definitions, will be different. For Wilfirlness pera

if ιι want any must have some further Criterion3 ie
being evident that nothing can be the Measure of itself.
If ngthe Criterion rs contained ιιι the Idea itself, then rtis
merely moriad, e..g If Virtue rs defined, The erling a

which is of some use, is this, How shall I know what the ,
Will ofGod is in this relpedi?

From hence it is evident, that the Criterion of a mixed
Mode rs neither the Definition of ιι, nor containedt'n ιι.
For, as has been shewn, the general ldea rs necessarily to

iixed or known allo, there remains nothing to be measured3
because we measure only things unknown. The general Idea
then being sixed, the Criterion which rs ιο measure or de-

Otherwise we shall prove in a circle.
