Crucerning Natural Evil. Chap, lV.

Man was testord to his Native Mortality‚ and sub-
jested to those other Inconveniences to which the
Order os Nature, and the Chain os Natural causes.

done sreqltlhtly nor tblbe expelled’for the sake of
Sinners. God can indeed preserve Man from atlual
Drath3 but that a solid Machine consisting of hete-
rogeneous Parts, such as the human Body is, should
pot be naturally Mertai, is impossible: 'Tis a
Contradistion therefore that Man, in the present

’ “ State pf things, should be by Nature immortal. (L.)

(L.) All the Objenions brought against this Sestion are,
tltat the Author maintains some things in it which deuroy
his own Hypothesis. ist, He holdp that aSoul united to
an aetherial, unisorm matter, persellly fluid and without
height or restionem may transport its Body where it phasee(

immortal. From whence the Objesior concludes, that ac· ”
cording to the Author, there is no connesiion between a Crea-
rure made os matter and mortality, or any natural Evils. '

But surely thiu is raifingObjeslions against aBoolc before
one read it3 For is he had read it, he might have seen that
the Author expresly affirmo that those Bodies are not im·
mortal, because incorruptible by Naturet sor the Matter-os
which they consili will not permit them to be so ; but be·
cause they are placed in such Statipns and Circumstancen in
which they may soreknow and prevent with leasure all those
things which cause corruption or pain. 'rom whence it in
manifest that· the Author supposes these corruptible, as well
as our earthly Bodies, but'it does not sollow from thence ,
that they must be corrupted. There'sagreat disserente be· .

heterogeneous‚ subject 'to the shock and impulse os others that
are likewise hard, heavy, tte, · ’
