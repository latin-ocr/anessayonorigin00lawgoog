xl Preliminary Differentiam

Poffelilon of it? Hence by dropping the ‚intermediate Steps

’ between Money and Happiness, they join Money and Hapa
piness immediately together, and content themselves with
the phantastica] Pleasure os having it, and make that which
was at first pursued only as a Mem, be to them areal End, ¹
and what their real Happiness or Misery confists in. Thus
the Connexion between Money and Happiness remains in .
the Mind3 though it has long fince ceased between the
tlrin sthemselves, , ‘·

The same might be observ’d concerning the Thirst after ,
Knowledge, Fame, &a the delight in Reading, Building,

’ Planting, and most os the various Exercises and Entertaim
ments of Life. These were at first enter’d on with a view
to some sarther End, but at length become habitual A,
musements; the Idea os Pleasure is associated with them,
and leads us on still in the same eager Pursuit of thern,¹
when the first Reason is quite vanish'd or at least out os ·
our Minds. Nay‚ we find this Power os Affociation so great.
as not only to transport our Paffions and Affeslions beyond
their proper bounds, both as to lotenseness and Duration;
as is evident from daily instancesos Avarico, Ambition,

'Love, Revenge, &a but also, that it is able to transfer
them ro improper Objesls, and such as are osa quite dis-2
ferent Nature from those to which our Reason had at ,first¹
gliresled them. Thus being accustom’d to resent an lnjury
done to our Body by aRetaliation of the like to him that
offer’d it, we are apt to conceive the same kind of Resenta
ment, and often expressit in the same manner, upon re÷
ceiving hurt from a Stock or a Stone·, whereby vthe hatred
which we are used to 'place on voluntary Beings, is substitu-¹
te din·the Room of that Aversron which belongs to invo.
luntary ones. The like may be observ'd in most os the other
’ Paffionsabove-mentioned, . - , ,
From hence also, niz. from the continuance os this As-
sociatim of Ideas in our Minds, we may be enabled to ac-
¹count sor that (almost Diabolical) Paffion called Envy, which ’
we promised to consuler.
Mr. Locke observes, and 1 believe very justly, that there
, are some Men entirely unacquainted with this Pasfion. For
