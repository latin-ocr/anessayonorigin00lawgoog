The Mistake which some have run into, viz. that Me-
rit is‘inconlrstent with albing upon private Happiness, as
an ultimate End, seems to have arisen from hence, viz„
that they have not carefully enough distinguilhed ,between
an inferior, ancl ultimate End3 the end osa particular
Atrion, and the end of Action in general: which may be
explained thus. Though Happinels, private ⁴Happiness, is
· the proper or ultimate End of all our-Albona whatever,

et that particular means of Happiness which any particu-

Atrion is chiefly adapted to procure, or the thing chiefly

Whenever therefore the particular End of any. Action is
