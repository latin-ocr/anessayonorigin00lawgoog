‘To conclude therefore, b Space without the liniteWorld,
ί ia to be understood nothing hut the poffibilityof Body further
‘ and farther without end, yet foasnever to reach to intinitys'

Hence appears the weaknefa of that common Argument urg'd
by Gaffendus, Dt.Csarke, and Rapbsan, sor the ubfilute Infinity
of Space, viz. From the imposibility of settiug hands or limite
to it: since that, say they, would be to suppose Space bounded
hy yomething which itself occupies Space, ot elfe by nothing·
bot which arecontradiiiions. Ι

Which Argument either first of all su osca that Space ia
really fome thing, or some positive Qut ityt which wants to
be proved. Or else improperly applica bounda and bouhieri,
to mere non-entity, orbare poffibrlity3 which has nothing to
do with the Idea of Bounda.

If'therefore we take Space in the first Notion laid down,
then its unboundedness will (as Dr. cudworr'hsays) fignify
nothing but the pollibility of Body further and further without
end; accordin to which Senfe, let us state their usual Qe-
slion in other orda, and the great sallacy and impropriety of
it will appear. What uthere, say they, beyond this Spacei*
You must imagine more such Space, or nothing. What is there
say we, beyond thie pofflbiiity of· Existenc'e? You must either
st solviturum..nillan ψ
such an odd kind of Argumentationi

Botis Space be taken in the second Senfe, i. e. as· Exten-
fion in abslraeto, then the meaning of our not being able to set
bounds to it will only he, that we havea power of enlargiug
our abstrait Idea in Infinitum. or that we always find in out·
selvea the same ability to add to, or repeat it; andis we always
find that we can add, we shall never find that we cannot add,

which (as a very eminent Writer'on the Subjecl1 observes) is

> , all the Myhery os the Matter, and all that can be understood

hy infinite Space. , .

But it ie further urg'd that there moll be something more iu
the present Case3 for we find not only a Power osenlarging the
Idea, but find it impoffible to set bounds to the thing3 whereas.
we can enlarge the Idea of Matter to Infinity, aad can also set
bounds to the thing it (ὦ 'In answer to the first part of this
Objeiiion it is assc'd, hat thing, Ipray you, but the thing in
your owo mind, that is, the Idea? Prove it to be a thing
and then we'll enquire whether ithus bounds or nott but to tfpy'
