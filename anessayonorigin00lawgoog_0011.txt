T is a common observation, that the ge-
nerality of such Freethinkers as are seriss .
rious‚ and have reasoned themselves out of ¹
> the Christian Religion, have at the [ame

time rejeeled the belief ofa Deity. This
must arise, ‘either from their entertaining
ι some Principles that lead equally to both
ι these absurdities3 or, which is more proba-
ᾗ ble, from their having no Principles at all3
ἱ from mere Scepticism‚ and a habit of rais-
ing Objefflons without.. ever attending to ·
the answers3 without proceeding on any
settled grounds of enquiry, or endeavour·
