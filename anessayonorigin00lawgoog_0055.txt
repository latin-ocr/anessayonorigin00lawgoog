quences of Things‚ and. Reasons of Athon, and are fre*
quently apt to ,deviate nom the Pathseof Truth into Enot-
and Absurdity. We stand in need therefore of some Rale
on which we may constantly depend‚ which will always
. gulde. and dire& us in our Pursuit·, and this, aa we have
seen, can only be the Will of that Being. in whose Hands
we always are, and who is both able and inclined¹ to re·
ward. us to the uttermost. Our next Enquiry then.mtrst be,
how we lhall secure this Reward to uS, or what will certain-¹
ly obtain¹ his F avom, and that is, in one word, Obrdieneee
the having a Regard to his Will in all our Αᾶἱοηε, and
doing them for this Reason only, because they ate well

what is done. on his Armant, in obedience to his Command,
or with an lntent to please him. The Matter of the A&

Aet may relate to the Deity‚ viz. As it tends in its own .
Nature to further or oppose the Defigns of his .Govemment:
But this will never relate to him in such a manner, as to
make the Agent a· proper Subje& either of Reward or Pun-
ilhment for it. , Το make one a Subjett of Reward for any
particular helion, his Will must be concemed in it so far
as to intend to merit the Reward which is annexedto the 1
Performance of it, or at least to will and intend the Per·
fomanee of that Aetion as . so proposed. To be a proper
Subjnst ofPuniIhment, a Perfon must intend the Breach ‘of
some law, orat least the Negleli and Disregard of it ·‚.or
the Commiffion. of such an A& as he knows‚· or might
know, if he desired‚.to be aBreach of it. Consequently
it is the Aim and Desrgn of an Aetion only which makes
