heis not thereby entitled to any F avour or Esteem: Be·
cause F avour and Esteem are due from me for any Aetion,
no farther than that Action was undertaken upon my ac·

. · But itis far otherwise when my‘Happiness it the mle ⁰
Fnd of that particular Action, i. e. (as I have explained
myself above) when the Agent endeavours to promote my
Happiness as a Means to procure my Favour, i. e. to make
me <subservirent -to his Happiness as his ultimate End:
Tho' Ι know he aims at my Happiness onlyyas a means of
his own, yet this leisons not the Obligation.

· There is one thing, Ι confess, which makes a great-al-''

s teration in this Cale, and that is, whether he aims at my
F avour in general, or only for sorrie particularEnd. Be-
cause, if he aim at my Happiness only to-serve himself in·
some particular thing, the Value of my F avour will per-
haps end with his obtaining that particular thing: And
therefore Ι ατη, under. less Obligation (caeteris paribus) the
more particular his Expettations' from me are ; but under
Obligation I am. ·

· Now from the¹ various Combinations of this which we

call Merit, and its contrary, arise all those various Appio ,

which we call Moral. · ,
